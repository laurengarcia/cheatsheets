UDP: User Datagram Protocol
Lightweight but not as reliable as TCP

- Size
Smaller packet sizes vs TCP. Header is 8 bytes vs. 20 bytes for TCP.

- Connectionless
Dont have to create and maintain connection.
More control over when data is sent.

- Error protection
Primitive form of error protection, 16 bit checksum to detect.
Does not try to recover from corruption.
Does have a flag to warn application of corruption.

- Packets
No compensation for lost packets. Tough luck for lost packets.
No guarantee of packet order.
No congestion control.
Tries to ram packets thru, hard on congested networks.
