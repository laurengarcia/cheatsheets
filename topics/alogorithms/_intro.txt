Algorthims

Five important characteristics of algorithms:

- Algorithms are well-ordered.
- Algorithms have unambiguous operations.
- Algorithms have effectively computable operations.
- Algorithms produce a result.
- Algorithms halt in a finite amount of time.


Algorithm efficiency is measured by:

1 Space efficiency: Amt of memory used
2 Time efficiency: # of operations


Analysis:
Measuring algorithms for time efficiency (or # of operations)
we calculate # of operations in the WORST-case scenario.
