Certificate-Based Authentication
--

When presented with a certificate, an authentication server will do the following (at a minimum):

1 - Has the Digital Certificate been issued/signed by a Trusted CA?
2 - Is the Certificate Expired – checks both the start and end dates
3 - Has the Certificate been revoked? (Could be OCSP or CRL check)
4 - Has the client provided proof of possession?


1 - Has the Digital Certificate been issued/signed by a Trusted CA (Certificate Authority?
  - must have been signed correctly (following the correct format, etc)
  - the signing CA’s public key must be in a Trusted Certificates store, and that certificate must be trusted for purposes of authentication

2 - Certificate expiry
  - certificate will have 2 dates listed in it: a date issued, and date it is valid to (when does it expire)
  - Is it valid for the date and time that the authentication request comes in
  - This is one reason why Network Time Protocol (NTP) is so important

3 - Has cert been revoked?
  - Every certificate authority should also have a service to publish a list of certificates that have been revoked
  - Certificate Revocation List (CRL).  This is basically a signed list that the CA publishes on a website that can be read by authentication servers.
  - Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is preferred method for revocation checks in most environments today, is almost real-time

4 - Has the client provided proof of possession?
  - Auth server makes sure the client truly owns the certificate
  - Successfully encrypting and decrypting of some random data ensures that the client has both the public and private keys
