Simple Sort Algorithm:

1 Get a list of unsorted numbers
2 Repeat steps 3 through 6 until the unsorted list is empty
  3 Compare the unsorted numbers
  4 Select the smallest unsorted number
  5 Move this number to the sorted list
  6 Store a maximum value in the place of the smallest number
7 Stop


Insertion Sort Algorithm:

1 Get a list of unsorted numbers
2 Set a marker for the sorted section after the first number in the list
3 Repeat steps 4 through 6 until the unsorted section is empty
  4 Select the first unsorted number
  5 Swap this number to left until it arrives at the correct sorted position
  6 Advance the marker to the right one position
7 Stop


Selection Card Sort:

1 Get a list of unsorted numbers
2 Set a marker for the unsorted section at the front of the list
3 Repeat steps 4 - 6 until one number remains in the unsorted section
  4 Compare all unsorted numbers in order to select the smallest one
  5 Swap this number with the first number in the unsorted section
  6 Advance the marker to the right one position
7 Stop


To analyze time efficiency we would create formulas to express # of comparisons and number of copies.
