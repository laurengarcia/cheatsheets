[SEEMS RESOLVED IN LATEST VERSIONS]

Docker on MacOS is known to have performance issues.
Filesystem access is slow.

Troubleshooting:

  - MacOS 12.5+ > Docker Settings > "Choose file sharing implementation for your containers" > choose VirtioFS (or gRPC Fuse).

  - Try running with an M1-specific NodeJS image (https://hub.docker.com/r/arm64v8/node/) by modifying your Dockerfile

  - If project is configured to run eslint at compile time, try setting .env file to DISABLE_ESLINT_PLUGIN=true & only use eslint on commits.
