BASH/ CLI UTILS
--

MAN
when in doubt, don't forget to just
$ man <command name>

LOGIN
When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes commands from the following files, in the following order, and reads and executes commands from
the first one that exists and is readable:

/etc/profile
~/.bash_profile
~/.bash_login
~/.profile

The --noprofile option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.

WHICH & VERSION
$ which node
$ node --version

CLI CURSOR
$ ctrl a    # move cursor to beginning of line
$ ctrl e    # move cursor to end of line

CLI ERASING
$ ctrl w    # erase previous word
$ ctrl u    # erase the current line

EXIT
$ ctrl c    # abort the current command

NETTOP (MacOSX) TO MONITOR TRAFFIC, I/O
$ nettop
$ nettop -P         # display i/o by process
$ nettop -m route   # show each route
$ nettop -d         # delta mode: can also press d while active to toggle
                    # shows current bandwidth usage instead of total

Press 'd' to only show active connection traffic while nettop is monitoring.
Press 'q' to quit.

FILE SYSTEM NAVIGATION
$ cd -      # takes you back to previous directory
$ cd ~      # takes you to home directory
$ pwd       # where am i?
$ whoami    # what user am i?
$ clear     # clear terminal screen
$ echo $YO  # display YO variable specified in environment
$ exit      # exit from system

LISTING FILES IN DIR
$ ls -l -a   # -a: show hidden files (starting with a `.`)
             # -l: show long form listing of files (perms, size, owner)
             # -r: reverse
$ ls -lh     # human readable size
$ ls -lSr    # sort by human readable size, reverse order

FILE SIZES (unix)
install via $ apt-get install ncdu
find the largest files or folders in current working directory
$ ncdu
$ du -ma | sort -nr | head -n 20 # List the 20 largest files or folders under
                                 # the current working directory.

GREP: SEARCHING w/in files
$ grep 'hello' file.txt   # find string 'hello' in file.txt
$ grep 'hello' *          # find string 'hello' in all files in dir

LOCATING files/commands
$ find foo      # find files named foo within dir hierarchy
$ whereis grep  # locate bin, source and man page files for a command

TOUCH
$ touch filename.txt  # update timestamp on existing files,
                      # create new empty files

COPYING (local & remote)
$ cp source.txt destination.txt
$ scp mytarball.tgz myuser@someserver.com:/home/myuser

MV
$ mv original.js copy.js

MAKE DIRS
$ mkdir mydirectoryname

REMOVING
$ rm -r -f -v <file or dir>  # remove (delete)
                             # -r: remove file hierarchy and dirs recursively
                             # -f: remove without any prompting
                             # -v: verbose mode lists files as they are deleted

SYMLINKING
$ ln index.js ~/some/other/place.js  # symlink first file to second file or dir

PROCESS CONTROL
$ ps                 # all processes in shell
$ ps-ax              # all processes on machine
$ ps aux | grep node # all processes on machine whose name contains "node"
$ top                # all processes running on machine
$ htop               # process monitor, needs installation usually
$ kill -9 1234       # force-quit prcess with PID 1234
$ jobs -l            # determine PID's in terminal

FOREGROUND AND BACKGROUND PROCESSES
(where program is called `count` in these examples)
$ count &            # run the job in BACKGROUND, display process id number,
                     # makes it block input, makes the shell not wait for its
                     # completion
$ count1 && count2   # command2 is executed if, and only if,
                     # command1 returns an exit status of zero
$ ps                 # check on job
$ bg                 # send job to background
$ fg %1234           # bring process 1234 to foreground
$ jobs -l            # list all processes and their job #s

DISCONNECT PROCESS FROM TERMINAL
(where program is called `count` in the examples)
$ disown count     # removes the process from the shell's job control, but still leaves it connected to the terminal
$ nohup count      # shields from SIGHUP (signal for closed shell), closes standard input+output, removes from program from shell's job ctrl

PERMISSIONS/CHMOD
$ ls -l                  # list files and their perms
$ chmod 777 file         # protections for user/group/others
                         # Each number is a sum of 1 (for execute access),
                         # 2 (for write/delete access)
                         # and 4 (for read access).
$ chmod ugoa+-=rwx file  # user/group/other/all, + or - permission,
                         # read/write/execute
$ umask 555              # used in shell's .bash_profile, etc
                         # display or set the accesses to be denied on newly created files
                         # where numbers are user/group/other
$ sudo node index.js     # execute command `node index.js` as root user

                        # display bottom of file as new info comes in

CAT
$ cat <filename>     # read file on cmd line
